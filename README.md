👋 Hi, I’m @HibaANBusttami-April

👀 I’m interested in turning data into creative solutions that drive business growth, combining my background in architecture, fashion design, and data science.

🌱 I’m currently learning how to leverage machine learning and AI techniques at AXSOS to discover meaningful trends and transform insights into strategic decisions.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data-driven projects that merge analytical clarity with creative intuition, especially in fields like predictive analytics, data visualization, and BIM (Building Information Modeling).

📫 How to reach me: You can connect with me via email at (bustamiheba@gmail.com) or reach out on LinkedIn (http://www.linkedin.com/in/hibabusttami).

😄 Pronouns: She/Her

⚡ Fun fact: I find knitting to be a form of creative meditation that helps me enhance my attention to detail—whether I’m solving problems in fashion design or data science!
